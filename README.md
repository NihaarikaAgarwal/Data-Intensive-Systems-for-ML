# ML Systems Engineering Assignments

This repository contains a series of hands-on assignments completed for the graduate-level course **Data-Intensive Systems for Machine Learning **. These assignments implement low-level ML infrastructure from scratch, covering topics like matrix operations, reverse-mode automatic differentiation, and GPU-accelerated neural network training.
